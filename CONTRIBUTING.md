# Contributing to ANTLR 4

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [antlr/antlr4 repo](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4), which will give you both key branches, `master` and `dev`
2. Make sure to `git checkout dev` in your fork so that you are working from the latest development branch
2. Install and configure [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) so your text editor or IDE uses the ANTLR 4 coding style
3. [Build ANTLR 4](doc/building-antlr.md)
4. [Run the ANTLR project unit tests](doc/antlr-project-testing.md)
5. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with your changes and make sure you're comparing the `dev` branch in your fork to the `dev` branch from the `antlr/antlr4` repo:
